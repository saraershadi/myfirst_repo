### In this assignment I would write a couple of functions that can analyze an array of unsigned char data items and report analytics on the maximum, minimum, mean, and median of the data set. In addition, I will reorder this data set from large to small. All statistics should be rounded down to the nearest integer. After analysis and sorting is done, I will print that data to the screen in nicely formatted presentation. I will submit a version controlled repository of these 3 files.
